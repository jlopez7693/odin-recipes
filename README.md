# odin-recipes
This project demonstrates my understanding of HTML fundamentals. In particular, this project involves the creation of a recipe website that hosts some of my favorite baking recipes that I use often.

This project showcases my understanding of the following HTML ideas:
1. HTML boilerplate code
2. Text elements, including headings, paragraphs, strong text, and emphasis text
3. Nested elements
4. Ordered and unordered lists
5. Links and images

The website is not considered complete since it will be revisited later when learning CSS principles.
