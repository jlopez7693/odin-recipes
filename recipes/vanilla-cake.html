    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter <em>(room temperature)</em></li>
        <li>1/4 cup oil</li>
        <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs <em>(room temperature)</em></li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks <em>(room temperature)</em></li>
        <li>1 Tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk <em>(room temperature)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Grease two 8 or 9 inch round cake pans. Place a circular piece of parchment in the bottom
            of the pans to guarantee that the cakes won't stick to the pans.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream sugar and butter until smooth, light yellow, and fluffy. 
            This can take 5-7 minutes, depending on your mixer.</li>
        <li>Add oil and mix until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs and yolks, one at a time, beating after each addition. Add vanilla and mix.</li>
        <li>Stir together baking poweder, salt, and flour in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Alternate adding in some of the flour mixture, stirring to combine and then some of the 
            buttermilk, ending with the flour mixture until <em>just</em> combined.
        </li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly in the pans.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out 
            with few moist crumbs, but not wet batter. <strong>Warning</strong>, don't over-bake the cake!
            If the toothpick comes out with no crumbs, the cake was over-baked.
        </li>
        <li>Allow the cake to cool for a few minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There are a couple of tips to make sure the cake stays moist after baking:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Drizzle the tops of the cakes with simple syrup when flipped onto cooling racks. Don't 
                drown the cakes, but make sure to cover the tops evenly. You might want a tray underneath the 
                cooling racks to prevent spillage.
            </li>
            <li>Don't let the cakes cool <em>completely</em> uncovered. Instead, double wrap the 
                cakes with film wrap once you can handle the cakes without burning yourself. This can be done
                after drizzling the simple syrup. This locks in moisture, preventing the cakes from drying out 
                while cooling down.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Consider using cake strips. These inexpensive baking tools cake prevent doming and helps prevent 
            a hard crust from forming around the cake. This may extend your baking times, however.
        </li>
        <li>These cakes can be stored at room temperature for two days. For long-term freezer storage,
            make sure the cakes are wrapped to keep them airtight. Cakes stored in the freezer keep for one month.
